Haptein
=======

A modest ruby application built with `async_sinatra` and `cramp` to play with
Event-Source.  This app makes zero effort to fall-back on other mechanisms than
Event-Source on your $BROWSER, so pick a good one.

Requirements
------------

Setup with `gem install bundler && bundle install`.

Start with `bundle exec thin -C config/development.yml`.

Check http://localhost:4567/ with your $BROWSER of choice.
